 anarcho_syndicalism:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 anarcho_syndicalism_desc:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism emphasizes the value of industrial labor unions as tools of political power. In the Anarcho-Syndicalist view, labor unions provide the means for their members to effectively exercise participation in political and economic life, while also providing them protection from capitalist overreach. Ultimately, Anarcho-Syndicalists aim to abolish the capitalist monetary system and to end what they perceive to be wage slavery."
 christian_anarchism:0 "Christian Anarchism"
 christian_anarchism_desc:0 "Christian Anarchists don't share the rejection of religion that plays a major role in other forms of anarchism. Instead, they see anarchism as the result of the political implementation of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the teachings of Christianity. Christian Anarchists also reject powerful religious institutions, and instead stress the importance of a direct relationship between God and his faithful. In the Christian Anarchist vision, the best way to wield political and economic influence is to distribute it evenly in participatory and plebiscitarian measures. Typically, Christian Anarchists tend to be Protestants, as they reject the spiritual authorities inherent to Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodoxy."
 decentralism:0 "Decentralism"
 decentralism_desc:0 "Decentralism, also known as Radical Regionalism, is the extreme version of confederate thought. Decentralists don't reject state authority altogether like other anarchists do, but they do advocate the disestablishment of any sort of bloated or major governing body. Decentralism advocates for subdivisions in the country that are to be democratically decided by all citizens, and the ability for any geographic group of people to break away and form their own subdivision if they get the approval of the voting public."

 communism:0 "Communist"
 communism_noun:0 "Communism"
 communism_desc:0 "Communist Regime"
 communism_acceptance:2 "Communist Acceptance"
 communism_drift:0 "Communist Drift"
 christian_communism:0 "Christian Communism"
 christian_communism_desc:0 "While most communists follow orthodox Marxist teachings and reject religion, Christian Communists, along with their cousins, the Christian Socialists, arrive at communist ideology through an interpretation of the behavior of Jesus Christ and his apostles in the Holy Bible. As a result of this difference in thought structure, Christian Communism is not anti-theist like other forms of communism. It also tends to look less favorably upon technological progress and the elevation of science as it is propagated by other branches of communism."
 national_communism:0 "National Communism"
 national_communism_desc:0 "Whereas most branches of communism reject the inherent value of nation and nationality because of their connection to chauvinistic thought, National Communists instead underline the importance of the maintenance of national identities to faciliate them as motivation and a call for action for the working class and the revolutionary movement. Often, National Communism is popular in colonial territories, where a certain ethnic group is oppressed by another in a capitalist system. Another model for National Communism that exists in the western world is that of Revanchist National Communism, where the communist movement is not inherently nationalistic, but points to some sort of injustice done to their nationality as a part of capitalism and the necessity of undoing that injustice before embracing internationalist thought."
 revolutionary_socialism:0 "Revolutionary Socialism"
 revolutionary_socialism_desc:0 "Revolutionary Socialists reject mainline communist orthodoxy, while at the same time advocating for very similar political goals as communists do. The disagreements that Revolutionary Socialists have with communism are diverse, and Revolutionary Socialism has become a - sometimes derogatory - catch-all term for revolutionary leftists that don't self-define as communists, typically in Latin America."
 vanguardism:0 "Vanguardism"
 vanguardism_desc:0 "Vanguardists, also known as 'Bolsheviks' in Russia and 'Leninists' elsewhere, are adherents of Vladimir Lenin's interpretation of a feasible communist revolution. Under Vanguardism, the communist society will first have to form a 'vanguard state' with a 'vanguard party'. This one-party state with an all-powerful political party could then in the minds of Vanguardists protect the communist revolution from reactionary counterrevolution until the transition to true utopian communism is accomplished. Vanguardists are typically committed to some sort of class struggle and advocate the creation of massive national military forces to spread the revolution to other countries."

 democratic_socialism:0 "Democratic Socialism"
 democratic_socialism_desc:0 "Democratic Socialists are the furthest left faction in the democratic spectrum and advocate a non-violent transition to a decentralized planned economy on socialist basis. Democratic Socialism upholds the values of freedom, liberty, equality and political participation at the local, regional and national levels, but argues that these values are inherently incompatible with both revolutionary communism and its associated one-party totalitarian states, as well as with free-market capitalism and its associated oppression of the lower economic classes. Democratic Socialists don't share the anti-communism of other democratic movements and are often willing to ally even authoritarian communist states if necessary."
 reformist_communism:0 "Reformist Communism"
 reformist_communism_desc:0 "Reformist Communists are a sub-type of Democratic Socialists that explicitly brand themselves communists rather than socialists. Effectively, their methods are the same as that of Democratic Socialists, but their chosen self-description often puts them at odds with both communist movements denouncing them as traitors and with governmental authorities distrusting them as potential revolutionaries."
 social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_desc:0 "Social Democracy aims to combine the effective allocation of public and private resources provided by a capitalist economic model with the social and economic safety provided by a strong welfare state. Social Democrats, while decried as 'centrists' by more left-leaning movements, differ from the supporters of free-market capitalism in their advocacy for the nationalization of key industries, public infrastructure and large financial institutions, as well as the establishment of extensive government oversight and intervention in the economy. While Social Democrats are distrustful of authoritarian communism, they are willing to ally with communists if it serves to defeat ultranationalist resurgence."

 anarcho_capitalism_desc:0 "Anarcho-Capitalists, also known as 'Libertarians' in Europe, advocate the liberal ideal of small government and free markets to an extreme. They advocate the complete abolition of central governmental and economic authority, but have no idea who will build the roads or assure the value of currency once the government is gone.

 christian_conservatism_desc:0 "Christian Conservatives derive their social and economic views from the Holy Bible. This means that they socially typically advocate homophobic and religiously intolerant positions, while they economically stand quite a bit further left. Christian Conservatism is not fundamentally opposed to the creation of a welfare state, as they see unemployment and sickness benefits as in line with the teachings of Jesus Christ."
 fiscal_conservatism:0 "Fiscal Conservatism"
 fiscal_conservatism_desc:0 "While nominally conservative, Fiscal Conservatives have abandoned much of the ideological entrenchment that is often part of other conservative branches to instead focus fully on the enforcement of what they perceive to be sensible and responsible economic policy. Fiscal Conservatism preaches small government in terms of political power and size of the financial budget, but will compromise on fiscal idealism for the purpose of protecting the nation's borders or economic interests."
 islamic_conservatism:0 "Islamic Conservatism"

 ethnopurism:0 "Ethnopurism"
 ethnopurism_desc:0 "Ethnopurism, also called 'ethnonationalism' by observers, encompasses several diverse ultranationalist movements that all seek to establish a generally authoritarian state in which all political power is wielded by the ethnic majority to the disadvantage of ethnic minorities. Whereas more radical forms of Ethnopurism advocate the deportation or extermination of all ethnic minorities, more moderate advocates instead envision a state in which ethnic minorities are used as politically disenfranchised cheap labor forces and subjected to regular forced movements to prevent ghettoization and the formation of regional identities."
 falangism:0 "Falangism"
 falangism_desc:0 "Created in the Spain of the 1920s, Falangism is a form of ultranationalist thought that places high value in Roman Catholicism as an identity for the people and their state. Falangism seeks to eliminate local separatism and intellectual diversity through the creation of an oppressive unitary state and a government-dictated universal interpretation of national culture. Whereas Falangism's Italian cousin, Fascism, seeks to establish government dominance over a weakened clergy, Falangism instead desires to unite the interests of church and state by subverting religious institutions and organizations and by targetting religious heads that dissent from the dominant Falangist interpretation of faith, nation and culture."
