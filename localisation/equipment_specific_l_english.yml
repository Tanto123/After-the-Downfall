 GER_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Gewehr 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Gewehr 98 is a German bolt-action rifle firing cartridges from a 5-round internal clip-loaded magazine. Produced by armament company Mauser, the G98 was the German service rifle from 1898 until 1925, when it started to be phased out in favor of the Karabiner 25. It served with distinction in the Continental War of 1914 against France and Russia and is remembered fondly by German veterans."

 GER_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Karabiner 25"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Using the same basic design as the G98, the K25 was a shorter rifle than its predecessor, designed to be easy to mass-produce. Its main strengths include easiness of repair and compactness for transport, while also not sacrificing any of the G98's firepower. It was adapted in 1925, although initial production numbers stayed behind expectations."

 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While not fully designed to supplement the K25, the MP31 is an infantry weapon that is to be given out to at least a third of German combat infantry, specifically those trained for close-range engagements and urban or night combat. Packing a higher fire rate than its bolt-action rifle predecessors, the MP31 allows for a higher amount of error from the rifleman and doesn't punish a misplaced shot as heavily."

 GER_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Sturmgewehr 34"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed to accomodate for the weaknesses of the MP31 at longer ranges, the Sturmgewehr 34 is designed to combine the reliability and predictable firepower of a bolt-action rifle with the high fire rate of a machine pistol. This 'assault rifle' design is bound to be revolutionary."

 GER_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Conceptualized as the first mainline tank design since the Continental War, but ultimately delayed to finish prototype stages only three years after its heavy cousin, the Panzer 21, the Pz24 'Biene' (German: 'bee') was a shift away from the heavy tank designs pondered during the war towards light and mobile tank units.

This vehicle was then designated SG-24 and, keeping with the theme of bees present with Panzer 24 models, nicknamed 'Königin' (German: 'queen').

Initially named the Panzerkampfwagen 25 and designed as a separate tank model, the Bienenstich was then repurposed as a subtype of the Panzer 24.

Whereas the 'Biene' featured two 7.92mm caliber machine guns of type Maschinengewehr 13 as its primary armament, the Panzer 28, dubbed 'Hornisse' (German: 'hornet'), was instead armed with a 20mm main gun as well as a supporting 7.92mm Maschinengewehr 30 Ausf A."

B on top of the chassis of the Hornisse. It compares favorably to its direct successor, the Königin (or Augusta) artillery wagon, and features a longer effective range as well as better periscopes."

Featuring a Hermann Ausf. C artillery cannon mounted on the chassis of the Panzer 28, the Hindenburg can even hope to contest the armor plating of some hostile medium and heavy tank designs. Although effective in combat, the Hindenburg is not well-liked with its users due to its claustrophobic interior and small entry hatch."

It features a Panzer 28 chassis mounted by a 20mm FlaK anti-aircraft gun. While enticing as a possible conversion model for when the Panzer 28 is phased out of combat in favor of a successor model, the Schwärmer is criticized as inferior to static anti-aircraft guns by its critics."

The 'Wilhelm' was named for the Kaiser on the occasion of His Majesty's 70th birthday in 1929. As a result, it also kept the ordinal designation 29, even though delays during the prototype stage hindered its development and ultimately slowed mass production of the Wilhelm until 1933.

Its concept combined affordability and a reliance on easily replacable parts with moderate firepower and speed. It was armed with a 50mm gun specifically designed to fight enemy tanks. In late 1930, it was given the name 'Wolf' in response to the designation of the current heavy tank project as 'Gepard' (German: 'cheetah'). It thus started the tradition of naming medium tanks after canines, whereas heavy tanks were named after felines."

The Preußen was then revisited in the aftermath of the adoption of the Panzer 30 model, as the 30's 50mm gun was significantly weaker than the Preußen's 75mm main cannon.

This was done to reduce the Panzerwaffe's reliance on heavy tanks and to replace them with less expensive medium tank models, whereas heavy tanks would be used exclusively in elite formations and light tanks as infantry assault vehicles. The result was a heavy medium tank, the Panzerkampfwagen 34 'Hyäne' (German: 'hyena'). It continued to use the Schakal's 75mm cannon, but its armor was more similar to that of the Gepard in thickness, while taking notes from French and American designs in angling its armor slopes."

Instead, it was armed with a mighty 88mm cannon and armored behind as much as 110mm steel.
