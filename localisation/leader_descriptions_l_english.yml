He refers to himself as a 'Stephenist' in reference to the first CSA Vice President (1861-1867) and second President (1867-1875) Alexander Stephens. To Garner, Stephenism refers to a deeply racist social conservatism paired with economic free trade tendencies and a diplomatic alignment with Great Britain.\n\n"To any God-fearing man, any unification with the satanic Yankees must be off the table."\n- John Nance Garner, 1924"
