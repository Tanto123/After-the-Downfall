 defensive_anarchism_desc:0 "Popularized in the early 1920s among anarchist movements that had to deal with the prospect of statist forces cracking down on their anarchist projects during their infancies, the 'defensive anarchism' is a system of self-governing cities and communities and contribute to a central defensive body, usually referred to as the 'Security Committee', that is constitutionally cemented and unquestionable. Even within the autarchy-oriented anarchist system, contribution to the Security Committee is compulsory and its structure is not to be changed until the revolution is secured.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 confederacy_desc:0 "A confederacy or confederation is a purpose-oriented union of sovereign entities. Within a confederacy, each participating entity has the right to self-determination as well as the right of secession, which is the main difference between a confederation and a federation. In a federation, membership is usually permanent.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "A Constitutional Monarchy is a state headed by a monarch, typically with a hereditary succession system, where the power of the monarch is limited by a central document, usually a constitution, and an independent body to enforce it, typically a parliament. The monarch can still take significant influence on politics and culture through private action or public speeches, as well as certain political appointments like that of a Prime Minister, but they are politically hindered from taking dictatorial action.\n\nThe most famous example of a Constitutional Monarchy is the Wilhelmine Monarchy in Germany.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 GER_council_republic:0 "Räterepublik"
 SOV_council_republic:0 "Sovetskaya Respublika"
 council_republic_desc:0 "A Council Republic, also known from Russian as a 'Soviet Republic', organizes political power following models of 'council democracy'. Under council democracy, each citizen is part of a population bloc that votes for a certain amount of representatives to be sent to a council. Then, in turn, each council votes a certain amount of representatives to the next-higher level, all the way up to the uppermost council ('Supreme Soviet' in the Russian model), which serves as the whole country's main legislative body. A Council Republic rejects a horizontal separation of powers into a legislature, executive and judiciary as it exists in other models of democracy, and instead, all power is exerted by officials appointed and dismissed by their responsible councils. In practice, there is also no vertical separation of powers, and the Supreme Soviet usually exerts crushing influence on the lower-level councils to bully out any dissenters and opposition thinkers that might in turn threaten the makeup of the Supreme Soviet.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"
 electocracy:0 "Electocracy"
 electocracy_desc:0 "Electocracy is a term, often used derogatively, for a representative democracy in which there exists not a single plebiscitarian measure in which the citizens can influence the government outside of national elections. Often, electocracies have restricted regional and local elections, and instead opt to have local officials appointed by regional officials, who are in turn appointed by national officials. Furthermore, the political rights of citizens outside of free elections are often restricted in electocracies, including the right of strikes and labor organization.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"
 federal_republic:0 "Federal Republic"
 GER_federal_republic:0 "Bundesrepublik"
 federal_republic_desc:0 "A Federal Republic observes the horizontal separation of powers typical for democratic systems as well as a vertical separation of powers between the federal and various regional governments. Typically, Federal Republics are symmetrical federations, where all federal subjects have the same rights against the federal government. However, the world's most famous Federal Republic, the United States of America, is asymmetrical and features territories as well. A Federal Republic is different from a Confederacy in that federal subjects cannot unilaterally secede from Federal Republics, while they typically can do so from a Confederacy.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 GER_industrial_republic:0 "Industrierepublik"
 industrial_republic_desc:0 "The Industrial Republic was conceptualized in the early 1920s by Belgian communists in response to the country's high degree of industralization and concurrent extinction of agricultural labor. An Industrial Republic is seen in the communist ideal as a part of the world society in which heavy industrial goods are produced and from where they are shipped to more agricultural socialist states like Peasant Republics, in exchange for foodstuffs and agricultural produce. However, models for the survival of a socialist Industrial Republic within a world that is still dominated by capitalist states are still unclear.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 military_dictatorship_desc:0 "In a Military Dictatorship, also known as a Junta in Spanish-speaking countries, is a form of autocratic government in which the military wields most or all of the political power, usually through puppets in the civilian government. A Military Dictatorship tends to accelerate the country's military advancements and produce high-quality officers, but will abandon the needs of the civilian population and trample the country's cultural and political character in the process. As a result, Military Dictatorships tend to be deeply unpopular.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 parliamentary_monarchy_desc:0 "A Parliamentary Monarchy, often called the 'Westminster System', is a subtype of the Constitutional Monarchy in which the role of the monarch has been reduced to that of a total figurehead, whereas in a mainline Constitutional Monarchy they might still have some influence in policymaking. In a Parliamentary Monarchy, it is customary for the monarch to be apolitical, to remain silent on most common political issues, and to rubber-stamp the acts of the cabinet and the legislature.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 peasant_republic_desc:0 "In agrarian-inspired forms of communism and anarchism, a Peasant Republic is one of the potential forms that a society could take. Peasant Republics would aim to greatly de-urbanize the country and decrease the size of cities. Instead, 'towns' of less than 30,000 inhabitants would oversee several 'villages' or 'communes' of less than 10,000 in their vicinity. Doctors, teachers and a select few industrial facilities would be in the towns, whereas the vast majority of the population would be organized in the villages, with jobs focussed on agriculture and livestock.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

In Unitary Republics, subservient federal subjects are not protected from the federal government by measurements of vertical separation of powers, like they would be in a Federal Republic. Countries that are considered Unitary Republics are usually democracies, even though there is no hard line after which a country would be too autocratic to be a Unitary Republic.\n\n[Root.GetGovernmentMembershipList]"

 totalitarian_rule_desc:0 "Current Democracy Rating: [?ROOT.democracy_rating]\n(Required for Totalitarian Rule: 0-20)\n\nIn totalitarianism, virtually all individual rights have been wiped out. There is no political elections, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of publication, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, freedom of association or freedom of religion. Increasingly, even the workplace of each individual is selected by the government during that person's upbringing, which is also heavily supervised through a state-controlled and legally binding education system. Totalitarian states are backed by both overt and covert police forces that prosecute and persecute any dissenters at any level of society, and apply a crushing state ideology in which every form of disagreement is high treason. This is typically enforced through a system in which denunciation of dissent by private individuals is rewarded.\n"
 authoritarian_rule:0 "Authoritarian Rule"
 authoritarian_rule_desc:0 "Current Democracy Rating: [?ROOT.democracy_rating]\n(Required for Authoritarian Rule: 21-40)\n\nUnder authoritarianism, almost all methods of political participation have been retracted, including the right to vote of most citizens and the freedom of the press. Authoritarianism also features heavy media censorship, including cinema, radio and the newspapers. However, authoritarian governments do usually not feature the overwhelming surveillance states of their totalitarian cousins, and some authoritarian governments still allow some minor private freedoms, like the freedom to choose one's workplace or religion, even though any sort of social movement that could arise from such indulgences is still viewed with great suspicion.\n"
 oligarchy:0 "Oligarchy"
 oligarchy_desc:0 "Current Democracy Rating: [?ROOT.democracy_rating]\n(Required for Oligarchy: 41-60)\n\nIn Oligarchies, elections are usually a sham and political opposition groups face numerous artificial obstacles that are not faced by the governing elite's chosen political forces. However, oligarchic states still mostly leave most other personal freedoms intact, with perhaps the only exception being freedom of the press, as the press is usually encouraged to 'self-censor'.\n"
 flawed_democracy:0 "Flawed Democracy"
 flawed_democracy_desc:0 "Current Democracy Rating: [?ROOT.democracy_rating]\n(Required for Flawed Democracy: 61-80)\n\nIn Flawed Democracies, almost all individual and political freedoms are fully intact. On the surface, it is usually hard to differentiate Flawed Democracies from their fully democratic counterparts. However, beneath the surface, there are uncomfortably close ties between big business and media magnates and the governing party, leading to extensive positive media coverage for the ruling elite and lots of criticism aimed at the opposition. Furthermore, minorities of various kinds, be they ethnic, religious or political, often face obstacles when attempting to utilize their right to political participation. For example, opposition strongholds might receive geographically inconvenient voting booths to discourage opposition voters from going to the polls, whereas bastions of government support receive a larger amount of polling stations to make voting more accessible and convenient.\n"

 democracy_desc:0 "Current Democracy Rating: [?ROOT.democracy_rating]\n(Required for Democracy: 81-100)\n\nIn Full Democracies (politicians of such systems often refer to them as 'Flawless Democracies'), citizens are provided with full voting rights, a generally fair and equal access to the ballot box, as well as satisfactory separations of power between government and media as well as government and non-political institutions like churches, the military, and big businesses. In Full Democracies, the press is completely free in its broadcasting, and information can flow freely from citizen to citizen as well as into and out of the country as a whole. Full Democracies tend to outperform their more authoritarian rivals in terms of academic success and tend to produce more intelligent citizens, but domestic disputes and crises are also much more visible and amplified because of the unrestricted flow of information.\n"

Army officers tend to value technological progress on the fields of small arms, artillery and tanks, as well as theoretical achievements when it comes to land doctrine.\n\nWhile not hostile to the air force, which they view as an extension of ground-based warfare, army officers are typically hostile to the navy, the investment in which they view as misplaced and useless."

Big banks are in favor of international trade and they tend to politically support factions that favor laissez-faire forms of free market capitalism without much government oversight over the economy. Particularly, the big banks seek to prevent government intervention in the banking sector."

Finally, Vajrayana Buddhism, also known as Tibetan Buddhism in the west, is widespread in Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia, Tuva and Kalmykia, the only majority-Buddhist region in Europe. Sometimes, Vajrayana is considered a subtype of Mahayana, leading to the dispute over whether there are two or three major schools of Buddhism."
 confucianism:0 "Confucianism"
 confucianism_desc:0 "Although not always considered a religion, the philosophy of Confucianism takes the place of a religion or is practiced alongside other religions by many people in China.\n\nConfucianism calls upon social harmony and strict obedience to social hierarchy, resulting in a culture that frowns upon social upheaval as a means of political self-liberation. However, the strict social focus on conservative values and lifestyles also makes the population, including the political elite, more resilient to reform and progress, be it political or technological."

A polytheistic faith practiced mainly in India, Nepal and Southeast Asia, Hinduism is divided into four main schools, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartism. The former three all favor a specific deity, Vishna, Shiva and Shakti respectively, whereas the latter worships five deities as of equal importance.\n\nHinduism is connected with a strongly anchored caste system that keeps political power in the hands of those that are favored by the religious doctrine. While this makes it easier to run a country, the caste divisions lead to unnecessary complications when attempting to mobilize a country for a unified war effort."

Labor Unions are usually associated with industrial workers and highly industrialized countries.\n\nLabor Unions want to improve the living and working conditions of the workers they represent and tend to favor the introduction of more efficient production processes to ease industrial tasks. At the same time, they also seek to introduce safer working conditions that reduce accident rates in factories.\n\nMembers of Labor Unions are overwhelmingly associated with left-wing political movements and oppose the capitalist system.

At the spearhead of those carrying these political demands are the naval officers that profit from such a culture.\n\nNaval Officers favor the expansion of naval dockyards and theoretical and practical exercises in the field of naval doctrine. They oppose allocation of resources to army and air force, as they feel that these branches of the military take away from the navy's potential."

 orthodox_christianity_desc:0 "Orthodox Christianity, also known as the Eastern Orthodoxy or Orthodox Catholicism, is the branch of Christianity that split off from Papal authority in the Great Schism of 1054. It is popularly associated with the veneration of religious icons and a great theological focus on the Virgin Mary as a secondary human figure of worship next to Jesus Christ.\n\nOrthodox Churches are often nationally centered, like the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church or the Greek Orthodox Church. This results in a strong connection between religiosity and nationalism, and produces faithful adherents of both the religion and the nation."

This includes Lutheranism, Calvinism, Anglicanism, Baptism, Mormonism and more.\n\nCompared to other denominations of Christianity, Protestants are the most secular and least dogmatic in their daily religiosity, and they tend to be more likely than other Christians to favor strict separation of church and state and to have a secular view on secular politics."

For that, Shiite history has a long-standing history of using elite forces like the medieval assassins."

 legacy_of_the_armenian_genocide_desc:0 "After the Ottoman Empire entered the European War of 1914 on the side of the Germans against the Russians, the Armenian minority in the northeast of the Ottoman Empire quickly became the target of racial hatred, persecution and eventually genocide on the grounds of an alleged sympathy towards the Russian Empire. After Russia's defeat in 1916, the outright murder of Armenians was replaced with a mass deportation from Turkish territory into the area designated by the victorious Central Powers as an Armenian state."

 ##FIN
 finnish_nationalism:0 "Finnish Nationalism"
 finnish_nationalism_desc:0 "Finnish Nationalism, combined with the Finnish national spirit of 'Sisu', has been culturally dominant with the Finnish people ever since the German arbitration at the Russo-German peace negotiations awarded the Turku and Vaasa regions to Sweden instead of Finland. With a revanchist Russia on one side and a lobby of Swedish nationalists demanding the Pori region for Sweden on the other, Finland will not run out of enemies any time soon."
 ##FRA
 french_revanchism:0 "French Revanchism"
 french_revanchism_desc:0 "France made peace with Germany and Italy in early 1917, after the Central Powers defeated France's Russian ally in the east. The French government agreed to peace negotiations while the French army remained in the field, giving birth to the French nationalist tale of the 'armée invaincue', the 'undefeated army' that was betrayed by French politicians.\n\nThe cultural shock of defeat has given birth to a new generation of highly talented officers and generals that seek opportunies to seek vengeance on Germany for the lost wars of 1870 and 1914."
 ##GER
 german_military_hubris:0 "German Military Hubris"
 german_military_hubris_desc:0 "Germany is the main victor of the European War of 1914 to 1917, also known as the 'Continental War' in English, the 'Great War' ('guerre grande') in French, or the 'World War' ('Weltkrieg') in German. Along with its Austro-Hungarian and later Bulgarian, Ottoman and Swedish allies, the Germans stood victorious over the coalition formed by Russia and France, while the United Kingdom, Italy and the two American republics looked on from neutrality.\n\nGermany first focussed on beating Russia in the east, while defending against relentless French assaults against the western border in Alsace-Lorraine. By 1916, Russia was beaten and agreed to peace negotiations. In the west, France and Germany agreed to peace arbitration by the Belgian and British government in late 1917 after several failed German offensives against French defensive lines, and Germany took large amounts of colonial territory from France.\n\nHowever, whereas revanchism and patriotic militarism remains strong in France, Germany has been overtaken by defeatist attitudes in a complacent military high command. While France is developing new tank models and preparing new forms of warfare, German generals still think their country invincible."

 mitteleuropa_member_desc:0 "Formed after the Continental War, the Mitteleuropa association is an economic and diplomatic agreement formed by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their northern and eastern European sattelites and allies.\n\n§RAn attack by a country not party to the Mitteleuropa agreement against one of its members will call the agreement's leader to arms.§!\n\nCurrent leader: §Y[Root.GetMitteleuropaLeader]§!"
 rechtsfront:0 "Rechtsfront"
 rechtsfront_desc:0 "With short exceptions in 1922 and 1924, the German Kaiser made it a policy to appoint only chancellors that would promise to work against the objectives of the German social democrats, perceived by the German imperial establishment as secret republicans and hidden communists. As a result, the social democratic SPD has become a beacon of opposition to the government.\n\nSocial democratic politicians refuse to assist the government, and their electorate expects them to continue to do so.\n\n§RCannot hire Leftist advisors.§!"
 triple_alliance_member:0 "Triple Alliance Member"
 triple_alliance_member_desc:0 "The Triple Alliance of 1882 between Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy was renewed in 1915, 1919 and most recently 1924. However, the actions of Italy in the Continental War between 1914 and 1917, in which the Italians initially declined to join the Austrian and German cause in favor of neutrality and only entered the conflict when the victory of the Central Powers was evident in late 1916, have made German and Austrian planners cast aside any pretenses of Italian usefulness in offensive diplomatic actions. The Triple Alliance is purely defensive in nature, and Austria and Germany have instead chosen their Dual Alliance as their main diplomatic tool of choice."
 wilhelm_ii:0 "Wilhelm II"
 wilhelm_ii_desc:0 "Although Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia, saw his popularity peak in 1917, after the victory in the Continental War, his popularity has since sharply declined.\n\nTo leftists, his controlling role in the establishment of the Rechtsfront governments and advocacy of colonialism and imperialism make him an uncomfortable head of state, whereas conservatives take issue with his inconsistent foreign policy positions, especially when it comes to religious issues (Wilhelm II is even rumored to be a secret Muslim sometimes) and the German position in eastern Europe."

 vittoria_dimezzata:0 "Vittoria Dimezzata"
 vittoria_dimezzata_desc:0 "The vittoria dimezzata, the 'halved victory', is the derogatory term used by Italian nationalists for the outcome of the Continental War of 1914.\n\nItaly had initially stayed neutral, refusing to aid her German and Austro-Hungarian allies on the grounds of the aggressive nature of their conquest. However, after Russia's defeat was complete and with only France on the Entente side left fighting, Italy entered the war in December 1916. Whereas Germany took for itself French colonies in central and southern Africa as well as Indochina, Italy was awarded control of Corsica, Savoy and colonial Tunisia.\n\nWhile the enthusiasm about the victory was great, the territories acquired were ultimately largely French-speaking areas, whereas Italian-speaking lands like South Tyrol and Dalmatia remain firmly in the hands of Italy's supposed ally Austria-Hungary. Perhaps, Italy's war is not yet over."

 aftermath_of_the_chichibu_coup_desc:0 "Emperor Yasuhito came to power in 1927, when the military forced his older brother Hirohito, the Showa Emperor, into abdication over the Emperor's disagreements with the army's conduct during the Second Kwantung Campaign of 1926. The Japanese people at large see this intervention as an unjustified attempt by the military to meddle in the divine imperial house and in Japanese politics.\n\nAfter Hirohito's abdication, the throne went to his younger brother Yasuhito, then known as Prince Chichibu. As a result, the new emperor's ascendance to the throne was dubbed the 'Chichibu Coup' by international observers."

 japanese_autonomous_army_desc:0 "During the 1910s and 1920s, Japan repeatedly violated the national sovereignity of Russia and China during the Vladivostok Campaign of 1916, the First Kwantung Campaign of 1919 and the Second Kwantung Campaign of 1926.\n\nThe military actions against China were undertaken autonomously by the local commanders of the Vladivostok, Kwantung and Korean armies and none of them had central government consent. These three entities are now effectively self-governing territorial dependencies of Japan under control of the Imperial Japanese Army's local commanders."
 ##SOV
 russian_republican_movement:0 "Russian Republican Movement"
 russian_republican_movement_desc:0 "After Russia's defeat in the Continental War in 1916, the tsarist regime fell from grace in the public eye. Only through the extensive use of the remaining loyalist forces in the Imperial Army, along with generous help from the former enemies in Berlin and Vienna, could Nicholas II hold on to a fragile power base.\n\nThe opposition to Russia's government has formed a government-in-exile in Geneva, Switzerland. This rival government consists of §Yliberal monarchists§! who want Nicholas to abdicate in favor of his son to restart Russia's monarchy on a constitutional basis, §Mdemocratic republicans§! who want the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a democratic republic with free elections, the anarchist and agrarian §G'Green Movement'§! that wants to establish a decentralized agricultural society, and finally the socialist and communist §R'Red Movement'§! ('Bolsheviks') around Leon Trotzky, who want to convert Russia into a communist state.\n\nThese four movements all agree on the removal of Tsar Nicholas from the throne and want to cooperatively form a National Assembly to democratically establish a new constitution, but it seems doubtful that they trust each other. All four movements operate behind each others' backs."

 treaty_of_riga_desc:0 "The Treaty of Riga, signed in February 1919, replaced the December 1916 Armistice of Smolensk, in which Russia had surrendered to the Central Powers.\n\nThe Peace Treaty, much harsher than the one that the Central Powers gave to France, robbed Russia of many territories and freed many new nations, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Crimea, Don, Kuban, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nFurthermore, the Central Powers forced Russia to accept the status quo in the far east, where the Japanese Empire had made territorial gains at Russia's expense during 1916 and 1917.\n\nThe treaty also imposes economic and military restrictions and assigns the Central Powers administrative and economic oversight roles in select Russian provinces and their governments. Some of the treaty's harshest conditions are bound to expire after 10 years, in February 1929. But it remains to be seen whether the Central Powers will keep their end of the bargain."

Ever since, a growing lobby of Swedish nationalists have voiced demands to connect the two colonial regions by acquiring what they refer to as the 'Pori Corridor'."
