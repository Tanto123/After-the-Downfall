 ## DEMOCRACY
 #####
 democracy.1.t:0 "Democracy"
 democracy.1.d:0 "The people have prevailed through darker, more authoritarian times, when the government told them what to do, what to think and what to want. Today, they wake up in a freer society, where their newspapers are neither censored nor biased, where their access to the ballot box is unrestricted, and where corruption is at a historic low. Life is good."
 democracy.1.o1:0 "I love democracy."
 democracy.2.t:0 "Flawed Democracy"
 democracy.2.d1:0 "While the system that our citizens now live in is not perfect yet, it is a lot better than what they had. Access to the ballot box isn't universal in practice yet, and the press still tends to favor government views - but political participation is increasing, and the people enjoy more individual and collective freedoms than under the previous, more authoritarian government."
 democracy.2.d2:0 "The decay of democracy is gradual, but it inevitably creeps into the homes, the workplaces and the voting booths. The ties between the economic and political elites are tightening, and the media is growing less critical of the government by the day. The number of polling stations also seems to decrease, particularly in areas with strong opposition support. Democracy is on the way out, and the flaws are more and more visible."
 democracy.2.o1:0 "It's not perfect, but what is?"
 democracy.3.t:0 "Oligarchy"
 democracy.3.d1:0 "While our system is by no means a universal democracy with a free flow of information yet, the government is retreating out of all aspects of private life. Political association and speech are less oppressed by the day, and widespread voting rights are restored, at least at the local level. The federal government is still very clearly removed from the will of the people by several institutional barriers, but these barriers are growing less daunting by the day."
 democracy.3.d2:0 "The citizens' widespread feeling that their votes and voices count less and less are not unfounded. The government has started moving most court cases about corruption and bureaucratic failures away from the public eye, and more and more government appointments are independent from the popular consensus. The government is also making a concerted effort to instate property requirements for voting rights, to further disenfranchise the opposition's supporters among the lower classes. Several journalists critical of the government were forced to leave the country, and it is only a matter of time before their colleagues start disappearing."
 democracy.3.o1:0 "Neither democracy, nor autocracy. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
 democracy.4.t:0 "Authoritarianism"
 democracy.4.d1:0 "The improvement in our citizens' private life are gradual and hard too notice, but with fewer secret police officers and a reduced government effort in mass surveillance, the state has restored several individual rights, including the right to free (private) speech, the right to worship freely, and the right to spend one's free time without constant government insight. However, this does not by any means imply an increased political participation by anyone except for societal elites, and the old party cadres continue to enjoy their position of power. But alas, totalitarian times seem to be at an end."
 democracy.4.d2:0 "It is safe to say that democracy is truly dead. The government has called off most elections 'until further notice', and the homes of journalists, radio hosts and cinema directors have become the target of frequent raids. The government is creating lists of 'undesirable' books, usually with political or religious themes, and several professors in the nation's universities have been forced into resignation."
 democracy.4.o1:0 "At least it's not totalitarianism."
 democracy.5.t:0 "Totalitarianism"
 democracy.5.d:0 "At least 472 inhabitants of the country's capital city have mysteriously disappeared over the past few weeks. The only common factor between these numerous cases, that the government does not seem particularly interested in, is that black automobiles were seen close to the apartments of the victims closely before the incidents. In the meantime, the government is reinstating draconic punishments, including the death penalty for most offenses, and is forming fifteen new offices in the national secret police service. The administration has also given out new contracts to a company that excels at designing wiretaps. A true surveillance state is the real freedom."
 democracy.5.o1:0 "The state is always right."

 election.9.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Social Liberal Front"
 election.9.d:0 "In the recent elections, a Social Liberal Front consisting of the leftists and the centrists have carried a sufficient majority of the votes to win the election in a governing coalition. The bigger of the two will take government, while the junior partner will join the government in support."
 election.9.o1:0 "Not the most exciting result."
 election.10.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Liberal Conservative Front"
 election.10.d:0 "In the recent elections, a Liberal Conservative Front consisting of centrists and conservatives managed to secure an electoral victory. The bigger of the two will now take charge of a new government as a senior coalition partner, whereas the smaller of the two will join the government as the junior partner."
 election.10.o1:0 "I guess this will make the capitalists happy."
 election.11.t:0 "ELECTIONS: National Conservative Front"
 election.11.d:0 "In the recent elections, a coalition of conservatives and monarchists managed to secure a decisive margin of the votes. The bigger of these two factions will serve as the senior coalition partner and lead the government, the other will join as the junior partner."
 election.11.o1:0 "Let's conserve some national values."
 election.12.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Labor Front"
 election.12.d:0 "A popular idea among left-leaning statists that reject cooperation with the anarchists, the 'Labor Front' is a coalition between leftist and communist forces. Such a coalition has in the recent election secured a winning margin of the electoral vote. The leftists and communists will now go on to form a joint national government, with the major party becoming the governing senior coalition partner and the minor party joining as a junior partner."
 election.12.o1:0 "The working class celebrates tonight."
 election.13.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Revolutionary Front"
 election.13.d:0 "Beyond the left edge of the democratic spectrum, communists and anarchists sometimes band together in anti-capitalist action to form a so-called 'Revolutionary Front'. Such a coalition of communists and anarchists managed to secure a winning majority in the recent national elections. The two movements will now form a new government."
 election.13.o1:0 "Death to capitalism, I guess."
 election.14.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Democratic Front"
 election.14.d:0 "In a bid to protect the democratic system, the forces in favor of democratic governments sometimes have to form broad coalitions to lock out extremist factions. Such a 'Democratic Front', consisting of leftists, centrists and conservatives, has won the recent national elections. The largest of these three factions will now lead the government, supported by the other two."
 election.14.o1:0 "I just wanna grill for god's sake."
 election.15.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Left Front"
 election.15.d:0 "In a broad anti-capitalist coalition, anarchists, communists and leftists often cooperate in so-called 'Left Front' or 'Red Front' governments. Such a Left Front has secured a winning majority in the recent elections. The largest of these three parties will lead the government."
 election.15.o1:0 "The path to revolution?"
 election.16.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Right Front"
 election.16.d:0 "In a 'Right Front', democracy-minded conservatives, despotic supporters of military rule, devotees of a politically powerful monarchy and backers of totalitarian ultranationalism all come together to form a coalition against various left-leaning political forces. These political movements generally rally around social conservatives and conservative cultural values like religious traditionalism or a commitment to hierarchy, as they otherwise don't have much overlap politically.\n\nSuch a coalition has formed in the most recent election, and the most dominant of the four forces will lead the new government."
 election.16.o1:0 "Compromising on various values to own the libs."
 election.17.t:0 "ELECTIONS: National Front"
 election.17.d:0 "So-called 'National Front' governments are rare, as they go from centrists over conservatives and despots all the way to monarchists and ultranationalists. Usually, democratic centrists and totalitarian ultranationalists wouldn't be able to unite politically, but a serious imminent communist threat might change their mind."
 election.17.o1:0 "What even is this government?"
 election.18.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Popular Front"
 election.18.d:0 "A 'Popular Front' coalition is in leftist terminology a broad union of all political forces from the radical left all the way to the capitalist political center in an anti-chauvinist effort to deny political power to reactionary and nationalistic political forces. Although there is much that divides anarchists, communists, leftists and centrists, these four parties have won a majority in the most recent national elections and have decided to forge an alliance of convenience against their adversaries on the political right. The largest of the four parties will now lead the government, that others will join as junior partners of the coalition."
 election.18.o1:0 "Politics makes for strange bedfellows."
 election.19.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Anti-Revolutionary Front"
 election.19.d:0 "A political constellation almost thought impossible and really only present in the nightmares of revolutionary communist, the 'Anti-Revolutionary Front' so far was a thought experiment in which every single party except for communists and anarchists would unite to a front of pro-bourgeoisie political forces to oppose the red and black terror. In a coalition that unites leftists with ultranationalists and centrists with despots, nothing but anti-communism remains as a unifying factor. Leftists, centrists, conservatives, despots, monarchists and ultranationalists stand united in this strange alliance that is now formed under the leadership of the biggest of these six political forces."
 election.19.o1:0 "What even is politics anymore?"
 election.20.t:0 "ELECTIONS: Anti-Chauvinist Front"
 election.20.d:0 "In a strange union of revolutionary, reformist and status quo forces as well as economic anti-capitalists with laissez-faire free traders, the 'Anti-Chauvinist Front' has formed to prevent right-wing takeover. Such a coalition was thought impossible, but has at last come about under the threat of a right-wing resurgence. Although the anarchist, communist, leftist, centrist and conservative members cannot agree on much, they will lead the government in a patchwork coalition under the head of the largest of these five forces."
 election.20.o1:0 "Bash the fash, I guess."

 germany.1.d:0 "A member of the Mitteleuropa agreement is under attack by an outside nation. As the agreement's most powerful state, it is up to us to make sure that the defensive obligations of Mitteleuropa are observed properly. We must come to the aid of our partners."
 germany.1.o1:0 "Come to their aid."

 germany.3.t:0 "ELECTIONS: 1928 Reichstag Elections"
 germany.3.d:0 "In the 1928 Reichstag Election for the German national parliament, the German political right, mainly focussed around Wilhelm II's favorite party, the DVP, secured about 40% of the vote.\n\nAlthough the conservative block did not manage to secure a governing majority in the elections, the Emperor, in the spirit of his 'Rechtsfront' policy, denied political participation to the Social Democrats, who secured one of their strongest showings in history, and again gave the task of forming a government to the leader of the DVP, signalling the continuation of politics as usual."
 germany.3.o1:0 "The DVP government continues."
 germany.4.t:0 "Reaction to the Kaiser's decision"
 germany.4.d:0 "In reaction to the Kaiser's decision to continue the Rechtsfront government of the DVP, industrial laborers the country over went out in protests to express the political displeasure of the political left about what they feel is an unjustified continuation of a conservative minority government.\n\nBehind the political scenes, DVP leader [Root.GetLeader] secured deals with the market liberal German National People's Party (DNLP) and the hard-right conservative People's Union of Imperial Loyalty (KVU). Attempts by the ultranationalist German National People's Union (DNVU) to enter the government on a more moderate platform were however thwarted by the objections of the DNLP.\n\nAs a result, while large amounts of the labor movement are out on strike, the government has grown into a more stable coalition of three parties, the conservative DVP, the centrist DNLP and the monarchist KVU."
 germany.4.o1:0 "The government grows stronger."
 germany.5.t:0 "KVU and DNLP send ministers to join the DVP cabinet"
 germany.5.d:0 "As part of their deal with the DVP leadership around [Root.GetLeader], the monarchist KVU and the market liberal DNVP got the concession of occupying one major ministerial post each.\n\nA few days after the negotiations concluded, Alfred Hugenberg of the KVU joined the cabinet as Minister of the Interior, whereas Otto Gessler became Minister for Economic Questions."
 germany.5.o1:0 "Let's get some work done."
