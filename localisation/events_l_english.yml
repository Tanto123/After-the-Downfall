 democracy.1.t:0 "Democracy"
 democracy.1.d:0 "The people have prevailed through darker, more authoritarian times, when the government told them what to do, what to think and what to want. Today, they wake up in a freer society, where their newspapers are neither censored nor biased, where their access to the ballot box is unrestricted, and where corruption is at a historic low. Life is good."
 democracy.1.o1:0 "I love democracy."
 democracy.2.t:0 "Flawed Democracy"
 democracy.2.d1:0 "While the system that our citizens now live in is not perfect yet, it is a lot better than what they had. Access to the ballot box isn't universal in practice yet, and the press still tends to favor government views - but political participation is increasing, and the people enjoy more individual and collective freedoms than under the previous, more authoritarian government."
 democracy.2.d2:0 "The decay of democracy is gradual, but it inevitably creeps into the homes, the workplaces and the voting booths. The ties between the economic and political elites are tightening, and the media is growing less critical of the government by the day. The number of polling stations also seems to decrease, particularly in areas with strong opposition support. Democracy is on the way out, and the flaws are more and more visible."
 democracy.2.o1:0 "It's not perfect, but what is?"
 democracy.3.t:0 "Oligarchy"
 democracy.3.d1:0 "While our system is by no means a universal democracy with a free flow of information yet, the government is retreating out of all aspects of private life. Political association and speech are less oppressed by the day, and widespread voting rights are restored, at least at the local level. The federal government is still very clearly removed from the will of the people by several institutional barriers, but these barriers are growing less daunting by the day."
 democracy.3.d2:0 "The citizens' widespread feeling that their votes and voices count less and less are not unfounded. The government has started moving most court cases about corruption and bureaucratic failures away from the public eye, and more and more government appointments are independent from the popular consensus. The government is also making a concerted effort to instate property requirements for voting rights, to further disenfranchise the opposition's supporters among the lower classes. Several journalists critical of the government were forced to leave the country, and it is only a matter of time before their colleagues start disappearing."
 democracy.3.o1:0 "Neither democracy, nor autocracy. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
 democracy.4.t:0 "Authoritarianism"
 democracy.4.d1:0 "The improvement in our citizens' private life are gradual and hard too notice, but with fewer secret police officers and a reduced government effort in mass surveillance, the state has restored several individual rights, including the right to free (private) speech, the right to worship freely, and the right to spend one's free time without constant government insight. However, this does not by any means imply an increased political participation by anyone except for societal elites, and the old party cadres continue to enjoy their position of power. But alas, totalitarian times seem to be at an end."
 democracy.4.d2:0 "It is safe to say that democracy is truly dead. The government has called off most elections 'until further notice', and the homes of journalists, radio hosts and cinema directors have become the target of frequent raids. The government is creating lists of 'undesirable' books, usually with political or religious themes, and several professors in the nation's universities have been forced into resignation."
 democracy.4.o1:0 "At least it's not totalitarianism."
 democracy.5.t:0 "Totalitarianism"
 democracy.5.d:0 "At least 472 inhabitants of the country's capital city have mysteriously disappeared over the past few weeks. The only common factor between these numerous cases, that the government does not seem particularly interested in, is that black automobiles were seen close to the apartments of the victims closely before the incidents. In the meantime, the government is reinstating draconic punishments, including the death penalty for most offenses, and is forming fifteen new offices in the national secret police service. The administration has also given out new contracts to a company that excels at designing wiretaps. A true surveillance state is the real freedom."
 democracy.5.o1:0 "The state is always right."
